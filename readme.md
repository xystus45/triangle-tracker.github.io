##behavior-driven development (BDD)
*what is a (BDD)?Behavioral Driven Development (BDD) is a software development approach that has evolved from TDD (Test Driven Development). It differs by being written in a shared language, which improves communication between tech and non-tech teams and stakeholders. In both development approaches, tests are written ahead of the code, but in BDD, tests are more user-focused and based on the systemâ€™s behavior.Given a scenario whereby the user inserts numbers,and presses the submit button,the outcome should either be a type of triangle or not a triangle at all.
##Technologies used.
